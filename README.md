* WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation

* THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

* WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work

* THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

* WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application

* THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
